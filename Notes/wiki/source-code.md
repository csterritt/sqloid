## cmd/sqloid

### cmd/sqloid/main.go

The executable entrypoint and thin process boundary. Maps `os.Exit(cli.Main(os.Args, handlers))` with `handlers.SQLite = connection.Session`, connecting the shell to real database startup; all other construction and dispatch live in `internal/cli`. `cmd/sqloid/main_test.go` re-executes the test binary as the CLI to assert exact streams and exit statuses, including the production connection path via `SQLOID_CLI_REAL=1` (see [unit-tests.md](unit-tests.md)).

## internal/cli

### internal/cli/cli.go

The mow.cli command shell (PRD-mandated structure):

- `Version` — build version string (`dev` by default; overridable with `-ldflags -X ...cli.Version=...`).
- `Handlers` — injectable `SQLite(path) error` and `D1() error` functions invoked after successful routing; nil handlers are no-ops so the shell is testable before `internal/connection`/`internal/d1` exist.
- `New(h)` — builds the app: `sqlite` command with `Spec = "FILE"` and one string argument, `d1` command, `--version`/`-v` bool flag, root action printing the version line to stdout or long help. Sets `flag.ContinueOnError` so mow.cli returns usage errors instead of exiting directly, keeping the exit-status decision inside the package.
- `Main(args, h) int` — runs the app and maps a usage-error return onto status 2; successful dispatch returns 0 with no CLI-authored output. Returns the status instead of calling `os.Exit` so tests and the entrypoint control termination.

## internal/connection

### internal/connection/startup.go

Owns SQLite connection startup for explicit and discovered paths (Issue #2):

- `FailureKind` — structured failure classes: `FailureMissing`, `FailureUnreadable`, `FailureNotADatabase`, `FailureReadWrite`.
- `StartupError` — carries `Path`, `Kind`, and a preserved unwrappable `Cause`; `Error()` already produces the exact one-line diagnostics rendered verbatim by `internal/cli` (see [sqlite-startup.md](sqlite-startup.md) for the message table).
- `Open(path)` — ordered, non-mutating pre-open validation: existence → readability → exact 16-byte `SQLite format 3\0` header (no driver involvement) → OS-level writability proof (`O_RDWR` open; prevents the driver's silent O_RDONLY fallback) → driver open with DSN `file:<path>?mode=rw` (never creates) → harmless `PRAGMA schema_version` probe. Journal mode is never changed; there is no read-only fallback.
- `DB`/`Close()` — wraps the opened pool. `Session(path)` is the CLI-facing handler.

Driver: pinned exact `modernc.org/sqlite v1.57.0` (pure Go/no-cgo), registered as `"sqlite"`. DSNs build from a percent-encoded `file:` URI so reserved characters in paths stay part of the filename.

### internal/connection/startup_test.go

Table-driven pre-open validation: missing file, directory, invalid/corrupt/short headers, and readability-before-header ordering (an unreadable invalid-header file classifies as unreadable). Every case snapshots size/mode/mtime/body before and after to prove pre-open validation neither creates a missing target nor modifies an existing one.

### internal/connection/opener_test.go

Opener integration: real databases open read-write and answer queries; journal mode (`delete` and `wal`) is unchanged by opening (`TestOpenPreservesJournalMode`); non-writable valid-header databases yield exactly `cannot open database read-write: <path>: permission denied`; direct classifier tests pin EACCES→`permission denied`, EPERM→`permission denied`, EROFS→`read-only file system`, and raw driver causes preserved verbatim; all diagnostics stay single-line.
